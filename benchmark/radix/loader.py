"""RTLLM: An Open-Source Benchmark for Design RTL Generation with Large Language Model
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10473904

We propose an open-source benchmark named RTLLM, for generating design RTL with 
natural language instructions. To systematically evaluate the auto-generated design RTL, we summarized three progressive goals, named syntax goal, functionality goal, and design quality goal. This benchmark can automatically provide a quantitative evaluation of any given LLM-based solution.
